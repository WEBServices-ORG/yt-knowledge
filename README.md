# yt-knowledge

**yt-knowledge** is a research-oriented tool for extracting, processing, and analyzing subtitle content from YouTube channels.

It is designed for **researchers, educators, and independent analysts** who want to work with spoken content at scale — without manually downloading, cleaning, or translating subtitles.

This project focuses on **clarity, ethics, and reproducibility**, not growth hacking or content scraping for redistribution.

## What does it do?

- Downloads available subtitles from YouTube channels
- Falls back to **local speech-to-text** when subtitles are missing
- Cleans and chunks text intelligently
- Translates content (e.g. to Hebrew)
- Enables search, summarization, and export for research use

You end up with **clean, structured text** ready for analysis.
